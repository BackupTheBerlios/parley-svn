    - hide per-post actions in a locked thread
    - allow users to edit their own posts
    - show if a post has been edited
    - added paging for long threads (fixed to 10 posts/thread for the moment)
    - if we have a post when viewing thread, go to last page in thread
      [ideally we'd like to go to the page containing the post, but we don't
      know how to work this out yet]
