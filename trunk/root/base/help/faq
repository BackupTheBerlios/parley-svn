<h3>General Questions</h3>

<ol class="help">
    <li>Does the world need another piece of forum/message board software?
    <br />
    <em>
    Possibly not. This is a personal quest for me. if it's useful to someone
    else that's even better.
    I've always thought that the Perl landscape was missing a well-written
    and functional forum application.
    Add to that the emergence of the
    <a href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst framework</a>
    and a desire to explore the benefits of this project and you've got Parley.

<h3>Technical Questions</h3>

<ol class="help">
    <li>What software does this forum run on?
    <br />
    <em>
    The core elements of the application are:
    <a href="http://perl.com/">Perl</a>,
    <a href="http://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
    and
    <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>.
    These elements are all tied together using the
    <a href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst framework</a>.
    </em>
    </li>

    <li>PostgreSQL?! What about MySQL, SQLite, ...?
    <br />
    <em>
    I prefer PostgreSQL. I don't have the time or energy to make the application
    compatible with everyone's preferred database. I'll happily accept patches
    that don't break the application's coupling with PostgreSQL.
